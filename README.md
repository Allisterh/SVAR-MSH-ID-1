## R Codes for Bayesian Inference for Structural Vector Autoregressions Identified with Markov-Switching Heteroskedasticity

by Tomasz Woźniak

> The project provides source codes and reproduction files for the paper mentioned below. Utility functions for the Gibbs sampler for Bayesian Structural Vector Autoregressions with Markov-Switching Heteroskedasticity, Savage-Dickey density ratio for uniqueness conditions and homoskedasticity hypothesis, and a marginal data density estimator are provided.
